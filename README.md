*Workflow*

Initialization:
Seller agents are created, and a set of books are added to their catalogues.

User Input:
The application prompts the user to enter the title of a book they wish to purchase.

Buying Process:
The buyer agent, with the specified target book, requests offers from all seller agents.

Offer Comparison and Purchase:
The buyer agent compares the offers, selects the best (lowest-priced) offer, and purchases the book
from the corresponding seller agent.

Result:
The application outputs the result of the transaction, such as successful purchase or book not found
and then the interaction is terminated.
